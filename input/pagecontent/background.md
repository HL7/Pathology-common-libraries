This cancer pathology reporting FHIR library has been developed by Cancer ePathology Reporting Project in collaboration with the IHE SDC/eCC on FHIR Project, both under the Orders & Observations Working Group, and other stakeholders.

The overall framework is modeled on the NAACCR Standards for Cancer Registries Volume V, Laboratory Electronic Reporting Pathology Version 5.0, May 2020 (Revised 2020), which defines how pathology laboratory information systems can report information using HL7 V2 Message format. This library of FHIR resources defines an over-arching data model and workflow necessary for sending pathology data to clinical electronic health record (EHR) systems, regardless of terminology implications. 

The project team is gathering input on this universal standard from subject matter experts, including those on the [International Collaboration on Cancer Reporting (ICCR)](http://www.iccr-cancer.org/) Australian cancer reporting registry standard through the [Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) Work Group](https://collaboration.opengroup.org/projects/soa/).
