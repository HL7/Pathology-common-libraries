### Overview

The purpose of this project is to create an HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) Library standard to support the needs of multiple standard Cancer interoperability scenarios. To avoid defining the same profiles multiple times, this guide defines Universal Realm focused profiles library for use by Cancer information systems in every realm, and other FHIR standards development efforts to define the appropriate US-specific FHIR profiles, value sets, etc., once and allow them to be referenced by each of the specific implementation guides. This profile library will provide a standard framework for inclusion in multiple use case specific implementation guides focused on the exchange of Cancer information to support interoperability among public health systems and reduce provider and implementer burden.
